# Money Supply in Terms of Stability - Working Draft

This is a conceptual draft exploring the link between monetary issuance and ecosystem regeneration, using real-world asset tokenization as a foundation.

It introduces the hypothesis that a stable monetary system must be tied to regenerative outcomes in ecological systems, using the example of Biocyclic Humus Soil (terra plena project).

Originally drafted with the [Stability Workshop 2025](https://workshop.stability.nexus/) in mind, this document is open for broader discussion and collaborative refinement.
